/**
 * The two test base classes [[MemoryReport]] and [[TimingReport]] are based on this common class. It provides some
 * basic utility methods and the default base configuration. See the companion object for all the common dimensions used
 * throughout the benchmarks. Don't inherit from this class directly. Use its two subclasses, instead.
 *
 * See [[Confidence]] for notes on confidence levels in the benchmarks. Our benchmarks generally have a test granularity
 * of 10, meaning that we evenly divide the axis into 10 samples. For example for testing [[ToxCore.bootstrap]], we run
 * it with 10, 20, 30, ..., 100 iterations. We aim for the smallest number to take more than 1ms and the largest to take
 * less than 100ms. If the timing is on average somewhere between 10 and 100ms, you generally get useful results with
 * [[Confidence.normal]].
 *
 * Some methods are very fast and may need more iterations to give good results, since commodity computer timers often
 * have flaky timing at high resolutions. Some methods may take too much memory when ran with high values of their
 * dimensions. In such cases, consider using a higher [[Confidence]] configuration or simply increasing the value of
 * [[exec.benchRuns]] for a specific test.
 *
 * We generally aim for a confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval of less than 5% in each direction. Higher
 * confidence usually gives no better insight. Lower levels may turn out to be very flaky and hinder effective
 * regression testing.
